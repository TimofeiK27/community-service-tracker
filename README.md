# Common Problems encountered 
## Release build shows blank page and console.log shows "nothing was returned from render"
This is mostly likely due to a comment being placed above a return line, causing babel to transform it (incorrectly) and break syntax.

# Tailwind
Tailwind config is located in ```tailwind.config.js```. Tailwind css is generated by running ``` yarn tailwind``` which converts ```src/styles/tailwind.in.css``` into ```src/styles/tailwind.out.css```. This ```tailwind.out.css``` file is imported globally in index.js. For production builds, purgeCSS (built in to tailwind cli) will automatically tree shake unused css when building ```tailwind.out.css```.

In order to ensure that needed css remains in the build folder, certain patterns must be followed when dynamically using css classes in react. These rules can be read at https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size/. 

In short, do not do this:
```jsx
<div :class="text-{{ error ? 'red' : 'green' }}-600"></div>
```
Instead, do this: 
```jsx
<div :class="{{ error ? 'text-red-600' : 'text-green-600' }}"></div>
```

## Best Practicies
### In order to make this repo maintainible, the following rules should be followed: 
Pushing directly to a branch should be blocked <br>
All commits should be done through pull requests <br>
All pull requests should be reviewed by at least one other person <br>
 
## Security

### Using Firebase email-link-auth is the safest choice
<a href = "https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/email-link-auth">Firebase Docs</a> <br>
Users get a emailed a link that allows them to sign in <br>
No passwords are ever stored which prevents unintential misconfigurations <br>
The user emails are automatically verified which prevents impersonation and binds the user to their lwsd email <br>
Only users from lwsd will be able to acess the database,  preventing outside usage/spam <br>
