# Work in progress 
## Cloning origin website with react components. Origin website URL: https://eastlakecommunityservice.web.app/.
### ~~Header~~ : https://github.com/eastlake-key/community-service-tracker/pull/7
### Body of main page : Not Done @zjjc123 assigned
### Footer : Not Done
### Login UI: Not Done
### Events Component: Not Done

# Common Problems encountered 
## Release build shows blank page and console.log shows "nothing was returned from render"
This is mostly likely due to a comment being placed above a return line, causing babel to transform it (incorrectly) and break syntax.

# Tailwind
Tailwind config is located in ```tailwind.config.js```. Tailwind css is generated by running ``` npm run tailwind``` which converts ```src/styles/tailwind.in.css``` into ```src/styles/tailwind.out.css``` which is imported globally in index.js. For production builds, some kind of css postprocessor should be implemented which tree-shakes dead css to make tiny bundles. 

## Best Practicies
### In order to make this repo maintainible, the following rules should be followed: 
Pushing directly to a branch should be blocked <br>
All commits should be done through pull requests <br>
All pull requests should be reviewed by at least one other person <br>
 
## Security

### Using Firebase email-link-auth is the safest choice
<a href = "https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/email-link-auth">Firebase Docs</a> <br>
Users get a emailed a link that allows them to sign in <br>
No passwords are ever stored which prevents unintential misconfigurations <br>
The user emails are automatically verified which prevents impersonation and binds the user to their lwsd email <br>
Only users from lwsd will be able to acess the database,  preventing outside usage/spam <br>
