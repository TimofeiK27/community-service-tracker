### ~~Footer~~ : https://github.com/eastlake-key/community-service-tracker/pull/29
### Login UI: Not Done

# Dependencies
## Browserstack + selenium

Generates screenshots for website based on ```Actions/screenshots/screenshot.py```. Screenshots are automatically uploaded as artifacts for each pull request to verify any significant UI breaking changes and ensure compatibility across platforms. 

Current platforms added to the config include: 
```
iPhone 8 (Safari)
iPhone 8 Plus (Safari)
iPhone 11 Pro Max (Safari)
Samsung Galaxy S20 (Chrome)
```

You can access screenshots by going to the artifact section of a github actions run and downloading the zip file.

## Netlify 

Generates automatic preview builds for each pull request in order to demo for breaking changes. Once merged to master, netlify will automatically upate the live website to the preview build.

## React-helmet 

Managment for the head element of the website (language tags, description, page title, etc). 

## React 

UI framework 

## Redux 

State managment library 

## Tailwind CSS

Utility CSS Library 

## Firebase

Email link authentication and firestore database

# Common Problems encountered 
## Release build shows blank page and console.log shows "nothing was returned from render"
This is mostly likely due to a comment being placed above a return line, causing babel to transform it (incorrectly) and break syntax.

# Tailwind
Tailwind config is located in ```tailwind.config.js```. Tailwind css is generated by running ``` yarn tailwind``` which converts ```src/styles/tailwind.in.css``` into ```src/styles/tailwind.out.css```. This ```tailwind.out.css``` file is imported globally in index.js. For production builds, purgeCSS (built in to tailwind cli) will automatically tree shake unused css when building ```tailwind.out.css```.

In order to ensure that needed css remains in the build folder, certain patterns must be followed when dynamically using css classes in react. These rules can be read at https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size/. 

In short, do not do this:
```jsx
<div :class="text-{{ error ? 'red' : 'green' }}-600"></div>
```
Instead, do this: 
```jsx
<div :class="{{ error ? 'text-red-600' : 'text-green-600' }}"></div>
```

## Best Practicies
### In order to make this repo maintainible, the following rules should be followed: 
Pushing directly to a branch should be blocked <br>
All commits should be done through pull requests <br>
All pull requests should be reviewed by at least one other person <br>
 
## Security

### Using Firebase email-link-auth is the safest choice
<a href = "https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/email-link-auth">Firebase Docs</a> <br>
Users get a emailed a link that allows them to sign in <br>
No passwords are ever stored which prevents unintential misconfigurations <br>
The user emails are automatically verified which prevents impersonation and binds the user to their lwsd email <br>
Only users from lwsd will be able to acess the database,  preventing outside usage/spam <br>
